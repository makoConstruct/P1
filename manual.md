# generally

The play objective is to pursue your character's desires and see how much you can optimize the board-world towards perfection. The real objective, which comes as a result of pursuing the play objective, is to practice dealing with conflict in a lawless place, to learn to weave harmony amid exposed difference.

You may wish to try playing with or without contracts. Contracts are agreements that two players can make where one player will take a -10 point punishment if a specified event occurs, or if they fail to hold up their end of an exchange. With contracts, Optimal Weave can be seen as an anarchic blank canvas onto which players may experiment in scribbling their own laws and learning what works.

As players improve, they should introduce more complex abilities, desires and scenarios. If a player's average score over the past five games they played is above par for their current level, they transcend to the next level.

# level 1

Start by having the game leader lay out land tiles a hexagonal pattern in front of them, with radius 3 (a central tile and then three hexagonal layers around it).

Try to keep the composition of the land fairly consistent. In the default radius-3 hex board composition, there are 15 field/forest tiles, 8 mountain/volcano tiles, 7 lake/ice tiles, and 7 tomb/void tiles.

The following illustrations show how players' agents (pieces) should initially be positioned for different player counts.

<span class="caption">It's important that no agent starts out within immediate reach of another, as some characters may eat others.</span>

Take care not to use any cards marked <span><img class="inline_img" src="level2.svg"></span>. I think their behaviors make the game a bit too complicated for a first session.

</div>

The lead player moves first. 

<div class="row">
<div style="flex-grow:1.3; flex-basis:0px; flex-shrink:1;">

The lead player should always remember to move the clock hand around the board at the beginning of their turn. When the clock hand strikes 12, the game is over, and scores are determined.

</div>
<img style="flex-grow:1; flex-basis:0px; flex-shrink:1; width:100%;" src="lead_player_clock.svg">
</div>

(We're not currently sure how many rounds from 12 you should place the clock hand at the beginning of a game. I think it will vary according to taste, and how much time you have. Experiment!)

Each turn, each of a player's pieces can move once, and apply an ability once, in any order.

Turns should be limited to 1 minute (everything that's tricky about real world negotiation is about the way it strains under time constraints). After 1 minute, you must carry out your choice.

When the game ends (when the clock hand reaches 12), reflect. Calculate your score and keep a note of it. If the average of your past 5 games were above 16 (?), that's very good, and you have transcended, you become a being of peace, and you may begin to play level 2 games with other transcended players.<br>●

To make things easier at first, you may wish to keep your characters' ability cards together for the next game you play. Instead of rerolling an entirely new character, you may prefer to just play a mutation of your previous abilities or desires by replacing a random one with a random new one. It's much easier to orient yourself in a new situation if it's a variation on a scenario you've played recently.

The cohabitive genre (which Optimal Weave characterizes) is so unexplored that I think you will have an interesting experience just landing anywhere. I encourage players to look for new interesting variants of play, and to come and tell us what you found in the <a class="element_link" href="https://matrix.to/#/#peacewagers:matrix.org">element channel</a>.

For the explorers, I should mention some ideas we'd be eager to see tried, but which we aren't sure how to implement yet:

- simultaneous moves, so that everyone can negotiate with whoever they need to in parallel over the course of a minute. The discourse will be so chaotic and vibrant! Players place an action card marked with one of their special paperclips onto the land they want to affect. At the end of the phase; the actions fire.

- Introducing more abilities over the course of the game. Sometimes randomly sampled abilities wont enable a person to pursue their goals, and we'll all be willing to allow new abilities to be introduced. There will be some kind of mechanism that allows people to fight against the introduction of abilities that don't break the power balance. Just not sure which to use.

- How about some Gaianism: Sometimes the world itself will have a desire, which is part of everyone's score. It might make some gameplay sense to tilt things a little bit in favor of cooperation. It would make it all feel more respectful towards the land and its whims.

- It feels like it needs some sort of climax, something we're going to find out at the end. The current climax of just finding out whether you have enough time to complete your plans isn't very satisfying. <br> The other prototype, [Final Autumn Together](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/final-autumn-together), did this by having the player roll a D20. If their score was above it, they "survived". This made the score goal viscerally meaningful while still mapping it to linear utility. The story was that the score represented the number of days supplies the players had collected, and the dice represented the length of an ocean journey they'd have to undertake alone before making landfall. I can't think of a similar story for Optimal Weave though. What punishes you for not enacting your preferences enough? Your shadow? (*It doesn't! As long as you were doing your best! Otherwise it might.*)

# level 2

After scoring consistently above 15 on level 1, you may "transcend" to level 2.

- Cards marked <span><img class="inline_img" src="level2.svg"/></span> start to come into play, and cards marked <span><img class="inline_img" src="level1.svg"/></span> may be removed. Be conscious of which cards you include. Those with the mark of the clown should be considered to be novelties, they drown out the other ingredients and only teach a simple lesson, so those ones should only be played with a few times.

- mess around with advanced movement rules, where some land types are a bit more difficult to traverse, imbuing the landscape with more texture:

<div class="row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;">
<img style="flex-basis:228px; flex-grow:2; flex-shrink:1; width:100%;" src="super_cohabitive_land.svg"/>
<div style="flex-basis:210px; flex-grow:1; flex-shrink:0;">

<span style="color:#efdcbd;">●</span> an agent can only move onto a mountain/volcano if that's the only action it takes on that turn <br>
<span style="color:#c3edf1;">●</span> an agent can only move out of water if that's the only action it takes on that turn <br>
<span style="color:#dedede;">●</span> agents cannot go directly from lakes to mountains <br>
<span style="color:#969696;">●</span> voids are impassable and any agent standing on a tomb when it is dissolved into a void will die <br>

</div>
</div>

- Also consider increasing the number of desires or abilities players have, as this always tends to make finding the optimal solution more complex.

- Play larger games with more players.

- Reduce the amount of time people have per turn.

- Adjust board size to taste.

# Ritual

A separate game using some of the parts of Optimal Weave.

Ritual Cohabitive is simple but deep. Its purpose is to quickly test the negotiation skills of the table, perhaps as a prelude to an important negotiation, or a new friendship. There's often benefit in exhibiting a demonstration that all participants are capable of good faith negotiation. When there is common knowledge of this, expectations will be heightened, and similar performance will be expected as you continue on into your inevitably foggier real-world collaborations.

Games are brief. At the end of the game, scrutinize and discuss the negotiation outcome. If it was unfair to you, well, that is one thing. But if it was too generous to you, that's a very different thing. Either case is an omen. Consider playing another round.

## Rules

Setup: Lay out a random board of radius 3 (that's 37 land cards).

![](p1_ritual_board.svg)

Give each player:

- 1 single-element desire card, making sure that no two players have opposed elements (unless you have more than four players, in which case you have to allow it), EG, if one player is maximizing lakes, try to avoid giving another player the ice desire.

- if there are just two players, give each 3 or 4 flip all abilities. If there are three or more players, give them each 2.


Each turn, each player may activate two of their flip actions. (Ignore the rule stating that the player must be standing on the pattern, the player has no earthly agents, in Ritual, and can flip any matching pattern.)

The game goes on for just 4 rounds if there are two players, 3 rounds if there are 3 players or more.

After that, no further actions can be taken, the outcome is determined.

# Pieces

The official names for the teams of agent pieces we've bundled with the game are:

<span style="color:#e0daed;">●</span> Pearls (or "Glue") <br>
<span style="color:#82bffc;">●</span> Slimes (or "Frutiger") <br>
<span style="color:#eeeeee;">●</span> Church (or "Sunday") <br>
<span style="color:#e2cfa2;">●</span> Wood (or "Halma") <br>
<span style="color:#3a3a3a;">●</span> Entities (or "Lollards")

## What are voids? What are tombs?

Some say that each voidland is a place where a great hole has been torn all the way to the shadowed heart of the earth. Others say that a void represents something more abstract, a wound in the body of justice or memory, festering and cursing its site.

And I've heard some say that tombs are places that a good spirit protects, or monuments to a great act of redemption.

Personally, I think the voids are nuclear wrecks. Failed machines that killed their builders and now spew radiation in every direction. I think the tombs are containment mounds, and if we could build more tombs we would be able to make those lands safe to traverse again.

But I haven't been able to find anyone else who will come work beside the voids with me.
