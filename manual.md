# P1: rules

## generally

The play objective is to pursue your character's desires and see how much you can optimize the board-world towards perfection. The real objective, which comes as a result of pursuing the play objective, is to practice dealing with conflict in a lawless place, to learn to weave harmony amid exposed difference.

You may wish to try playing with or without contracts. Contracts are agreements that two players can make where one player will take a -10 point punishment if a specified event occurs, or if they fail to hold up their end of an exchange. With contracts, P1 can be seen as an anarchic blank canvas onto which players may experiment in scribbling their own laws and learning what works.

As players improve, they should introduce more complex abilities, desires and scenarios. If a player's average score over the past five games they played is above par for their current level, they transcend to the next level.

## level 1

Start by having the game leader lay out land tiles in a spiraling hexagonal pattern in front of them, with radius 3 (a central tile and then three hexagonal layers around it). The following illustrations show how players' pieces should be laid out for different player counts.

<span class="caption">It's important that nobody starts out within immediate reach of another, as some characters may eat others.</span>

Take care not to use any cards marked <span><img class="inline_img" src="level2.svg"></span>. I think their behaviors make the game a bit too complicated for a first session.

![](player_count.svg)
<div class="row">
<div style="flex-grow:1; flex-basis:0;">

for 2 players, give each player
3 desires
4 abilities

</div>
<div style="flex-grow:1; flex-basis:0;">

for 3 players,

3 abilities

</div>
<div style="flex-grow:1; flex-basis:0;">

for 4 or more players, 
give each player
2 desires
2 abilities

</div>
</div>

The lead player moves first. 

<div class="row">
<div style="flex-grow:1.3; flex-basis:0px; flex-shrink:1;">

The lead player should always remember to move the clock hand around the board at the beginning of their turn. When the clock hand strikes 12, the game is over, and scores are determined.

</div>
<img style="flex-grow:1; flex-basis:0px; flex-shrink:1; width:100%;" src="lead_player_clock.svg">
</div>

(We're not currently sure how many rounds from 12 you should place the clock hand at the beginning of a game. I think it will vary according to taste, and how much time you have. Experiment!)

Each turn, each of a player's pieces can move once, and apply an ability once, in any order.

Turns should be limited to 1 minute (everything that's tricky about real world negotiation is about the way it strains under time constraints). After 1 minute, you must carry out your choice.

When the game ends (when the clock hand reaches 12), reflect. Calculate your score and keep a note of it. If the average of your past 5 games were above 16 (?), that's very good, and you have transcended, you become a being of peace, and you may begin to play level 2 games with other transcended players.<br>●

To make things easier at first, you may wish to keep your characters' ability cards together for the next game you play. Instead of rerolling an entirely new character, you may prefer to just play a mutation of your previous abilities or desires by replacing a random one with a random new one. It's much easier to orient yourself in a new situation if it's a variation on a scenario you've played recently.

</div>
</div>

The cohabitive genre (which P1 characterizes) is so unexplored that I think you will have an interesting experience just landing anywhere. I encourage players to look for new interesting variants of play, and to come and tell us what you found in the <a class="element_link" href="https://matrix.to/#/#peacewagers:matrix.org">element channel</a>.

## level 2

After scoring consistently above 15 on level 1, you may "transcend" to level 2.

- Cards marked <span><img class="inline_img" src="level2.svg"/></span> start to come into play, and cards marked <span><img class="inline_img" src="level1.svg"/></span> may be removed. Be conscious of which cards you include. Those with the mark of the clown should be considered to be novelties, they drown out the other ingredients and only teach a simple lesson, so those ones should only be played with a few times.

- mess around with advanced movement rules, where some land types are a bit more difficult to traverse, imbuing the landscape with more texture:

<div class="row" style="flex-wrap: wrap;">
<img style="flex-basis:228px; flex-grow:2; flex-shrink:1; width:100%;" src="super_cohabitive_land.svg"/>
<div style="flex-basis:210px; flex-grow:1; flex-shrink:0;">

<span style="color:#efdcbd;">●</span> an agent can only move onto a mountain/volcano if that's the only action it takes on that turn <br>
<span style="color:#c3edf1;">●</span> an agent can only move out of water if that's the only action it takes on that turn <br>
<span style="color:#dedede;">●</span> agents cannot go directly from lakes to mountains <br>
<span style="color:#969696;">●</span> voids are impassable and any agent standing on a tomb when it is dissolved into a void will die <br>

</div>
</div>

- Also consider increasing the number of desires or abilities players have, as this always tends to make finding the optimal solution more complex.

- Reduce the amount of time people have per turn.

- Adjust board size to taste.

## Ritual

A separate game using some of the parts of P1.

Ritual Cohabitive is simple but deep. Its purpose is to quickly test the negotiation skills of the table, perhaps as a prelude to an important negotiation, or a new friendship. There's often benefit in exhibiting a demonstration that all participants are capable of good faith negotiation. When there is common knowledge of this, expectations will be heightened, and similar performance will be expected as you continue on into your inevitably foggier real-world collaborations.

Games are brief. At the end of the game, scrutinize and discuss the negotiation outcome. If it was unfair to you, well, that is one thing. But if it was too generous to you, that's a very different thing. Either case is an omen. Consider playing another round.

### Rules

Setup: Lay out a random board of radius 3 (that's 37 land cards).

<div class="row" style="flex-wrap: wrap; align-items:start;">
<div style="flex-basis:210px; flex-grow:1; flex-shrink:0;">

Give each player:

- 1 single-element desire card, making sure that no two players have opposed elements (unless you have more than four players, in which case you have to allow it), EG, if one player is maximizing lakes, try to avoid giving another player the ice desire.

- if there are just two players, give each 3 or 4 flip all abilities. If there are three or more players, give them each 2.

</div>
<img style="flex-basis:145px; flex-grow:1; flex-shrink:1; width:100%; max-width:230px;" src="p1_ritual_board.svg">
</div>

Each turn, each player may activate two of their flip actions. (Ignore the rule stating that the player must be standing on the pattern, the player has no earthly agents, in Ritual, and can flip any matching pattern.)

The game goes on for just 4 rounds if there are two players, 3 rounds if there are 3 players or more.

After that, no further actions can be taken, the outcome is determined.
