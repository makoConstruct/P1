## P1. Rules

### In general

There is only one world, and only a bit of time.

Each pair has different desire cards, which state how important different features of the environment are to them. Their goal is to bring the sum of their desires towards optimal. To do this they will have to navigate the desires of other players, which conflict with theirs, but sometimes also harmonize. There will be a plan that you can agree on, and the plan you can agree on is usually better than war.

There can be war. This is a world where violence is possible.

There are multiple levels of play, which progressively introduce more complex means, desires and scenarios. If a player's average score over the past five games they played is above par for their current level, they transcend to the next level.

[todo] Is each series the spring before a summer, during which scores are taken and the players lie dormant? (name: Stewards of Spring)

### Specifically (Level 1)

Start by having the game leader lay out land tiles in a spiraling hexagonal pattern in front of them, with radius 3 (a central tile and then three hexagonal layers around it). The following illustrations show how players pieces are laid out for different player counts.

[insert diagrams]

For 2 players, players should each have 3 desire cards, 4 abilities on the larger of their pieces and 2 on the smaller.

For 3 players, players should each have 2 desire cards, 3 abilities on the larger piece and 2 on the smaller. (The reason for the reduction is that introducing more players enormously increases the complexity, I should probably reduce it even more.)

For 4 and upwards, 2 desires, 2 on the larger and 1 on the smaller.

The lead player moves first. Each of their pieces can move and activate just one of their abilities, in any order. Turns should be limited to [todo] 1 minute (everything that's interesting about negotiation is about the way it strains under time constraints).

After the 12th round, the game ends, scores are measured.

- Keep a note of your score. If the average of your past 5 games were above [todo: measure, tweak] 16, you have transcended, you are a being of peace, and you may begin to play level 2 games with other transcended players.

- To make things easier at first, you may wish to keep your characters' means cards together for the next game you play. Instead of rerolling an entirely new character, you may prefer to alter one or two of your means or ends. It's much easier to orient yourself in a new situation if it's a variation on one we've seen before.

### Level 2

We haven't played enough to know what level 2 should be like yet, but I have some ideas for means and ends that are a bit too complicated for level 1.
