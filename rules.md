## P1. Rules

### In general

There is only one world, and only a bit of time.

Each pair has different desire cards, which state how important different features of the environment are to them. Their goal is to bring the sum of their desires towards optimal. To do this they will have to navigate the desires of other players, which conflict with theirs, but sometimes also harmonize. There will be a plan that you can agree on, and the plan you can agree on is usually better than war.

There can be war. This is a world where violence is possible.

There are multiple levels of play, which progressively introduce more complex means, desires and scenarios. If a player's average score over the past five games they played is above par for their current level, they transcend to the next level.

### Specifically (Level 1)

Start by having the game leader lay out land tiles in a spiraling hexagonal pattern in front of them, with radius 3 (a central tile and then three hexagonal layers around it). The following illustrations show how players pieces are laid out for different player counts.

[insert diagrams]

For 2 players, players should each have 3 desire cards, 4 abilities on the larger of their pieces and 2 on the smaller.

For 3 players, players should each have 2 desire cards, 3 abilities on the larger piece and 2 on the smaller. (The reason for the reduction is that introducing more players enormously increases the complexity, I should probably reduce it even more.)

For 4 and upwards, 2 desires, 2 on the larger and 1 on the smaller.

The lead player moves first. Each of their pieces can move and activate just one of their abilities, in any order.

### Level 2

We haven't played enough to know what level 2 should be like yet.
