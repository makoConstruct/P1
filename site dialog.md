# P1. a prototype cohabitive game

Negotiation determines everything, it fords us through all collective decisionmaking, it renders difference and disagreement harmless, it delivers us to mutually agreemeable political outcomes. Despite its importance, in its naturally occurring form it is rarely fun, we tend to approach interpersonal conflicts in our life in avoidant and conservative ways, so we don't learn or experiment very much, we all end up being structurally inept in it, and ineptitude in negotiation is implicated in every tragedy, in every case it has been a situation where two parties couldn't develop a mutually agreeable plan together within the limited time they had available, or where the plan suffered and turned out poor, and a woeful history was carried out instead.

P1 is a new kind of game that makes it easy to become more skilful in negotiation.

There have been no other games like this. Most games are purely competitive, others are purely cooperative. Even games called "semi-cooperative" tend to assign goals to their villains which are perfectly opposed to the goals of the allies ("zero-sum"), for which no compromise is possible, and often these goals are hidden, which makes dialog unimaginable and weakly against the rules.

We do need a *game* about negotiation. Our real life interpersonal dramas generally make poor learning experiences, punishing explorative play with permanent injuries. A game, in most cases, is just a context in which practicing and experimenting with original methods and strategies is encouraged.

P1 is also a lot more legible than real life conflicts tend to be: The abilities, actions and goals of all of the players are out in the open[^1], so when the game ends, we can easily make sense of whatever happened and learn from our experience.

P1 presents two levels of play and an additional simpler cohabitive game that can be played with the same pieces, Ritual Cohabitive. The components of P1 can also be thought of as a modular toolset for exploring the cohabitive gamespace. Cohabitive games are so underexplored that I'd expect players to find something interesting wherever they land.

If you do find something really interesting, the community wants to hear your findings. As it has been for any developing genre, the first great cohabitive game will arise from a dialog of experimental works. We will stumble and then we will learn to walk and then we will learn to run. And then when we apply what we've learned to the world's negotiation problems and theoretical deadlocks, we should expect to find something really interesting.

Let's embark!

[^1]:
    Hidden goals are a common challenge in real world negotiation problems, we'd agree that cohabitive games should discuss information warfare and its dissolution in the elicitation of the true preferences of each party, *eventually*. The author of P1 thinks that this is too steep a challenge to include in early cohabitive games, as hidden goals make it difficult to interpret anything a player does, or to negotiate productively. To imply that hiding our goals is a stable equilibrium will mislead players and make it near impossible for them to find the salve.
    
    Hidden goals are a pretty horrible mechanic in general. To engage fruitfully with hidden goal situations, players need to have first learned the probability distribution of possible goals (*which goals other players could have*), and what all sorts of goals can look like in motion. Despite these things being useful for navigating through foggy moonless nights, they are more easily learned on a clear day.
