<!-- Good games often facilitate some kind of practice that's difficult to get anywhere else. I hope that Optimal Weave will provide helpful inspiration for further development of a [new kind of game](https://makopool.com/peacewagers.html) that we expect to facilitate a richer gamut of dynamics between player characters, as well as a fun practice space for negotiation. -->

A good game facilitates experiences that are difficult to get anywhere else. Optimal Weave offers experience in the social rhythms of cooperative bargaining, experimental peace-craft, negotiation amid anarchy. We hope it will inspire further <a href="https://makopool.com/peacewagers.html" class="normal_color">cohabitive games</a>, a new genre of multiplayer games that always discuss the realities of conflict but which also allow players to develop alternatives to violence, often tending to be non-zero-sum. We expect this kind of game to facilitate a richer variety of relationships and dynamics between player characters, and when done well, the appeal of that be clear to all.

<!-- We designed Optimal Weave as a practicing space for the crucial missing skill of cooperative bargaining, the design of conditions of peace, negotiation. We hope it can provide inspiration for <a href="https://makopool.com/peacewagers.html" class="normal_color">a new kind of game</a>.  non-zero-sum, reckoning with conflict but never closing the door to better alternatives to it. Among other things, we also expect this kind of game to facilitate a richer variety of relationships and dynamics between player characters. -->

Most of the difficulty of collective decisionmaking concerns the skill of negotiation. Skilfull negotiation renders difference and disagreement harmless, improving political outcomes, building peace, *loosening the divergant wills to converge towards the optimal weave*. Negotiation failure is centrally implicated in every tragedy. Every demonstration of force and will that was measured in wasted lives can be blamed on negotiation inefficiencies. So, we think there is probably a craving, out there, that these games can sate.

When negotiation problems pop up in daily life, we tend to approach them in avoidant and conservative ways, we don't experiment or learn quite enough. We are missing a crucial social skill. To lower the stakes of experimental practice in negotiation, we need the ability to try many things in many scenarios in a time-efficient way and then forget and forgive what didn't work, which is to say, what we need is a *game*.

Optimal Weave presents two levels of play, and an additional simpler cohabitive game that can be played with the same pieces. The components of P1 can also be thought of as a modular toolset for exploring the cohabitive game space. Cohabitive games are so underexplored that I'd expect players to find something interesting wherever they land.

Let's embark! <a class="special_button" href="#eebie_deebie">**get the game**</a>

Or, if you want it free and sooner with components that aren't as nice, <a class="special_button special_button_smaller" href="optimal_weave_pnp_v0_1.zip">**get the print version**</a>. The truth is, if you want to participate in development, it's good to get used to iterating with quick printed paper versions.
