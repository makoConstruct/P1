[] Use Nix so that people don't have to install Rust?... (but then they need to know nix...)
[] Try to use resvg instead of inkscape, removes a big dependency. Include the fonts.
[x] generate ends preferring the largest chain of contiguous land of two types. Excited about this one.
- first level abilities
    - overwrite x adjacent to y with z
    - from x flip all adjacent y to opposite(y)
    - I think a swap ability is too destabilizing, it affects at least 8 tiles
    - hm generally most abilities (including kill abilities) should cause a flip. Raw flip is boring.
- some second level cards
    - abilities that must do two paired conversions
    - travel ability that only goes from one type to a different type (not reversible)
    - travel ability that only goes towards or away from the caster #clown
