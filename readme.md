This generates the svgs for the cards for the prototype [cohabitive game](https://makopool.com/peacewagers.html), P1. It can then invoke inkscape to generate `generated_card_pngs`, which can be dragged into thegamecrafter as mini cards.

### usage

install Rust, Inkscape and the [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik) font. Run `cargo run`.

If you want to make a card, look at other card generation code that generates similar cards and adapt it to your needs. If you need help with understanding rust, we're here for you and you can get us in the [cohabitive games element chat](https://matrix.to/#/#peacewagers:matrix.org). If you need help with inkscape... I'm sorry about inkscape. But I'll try to help.

If you want to draw some cards entirely in inkscape instead of generating them, you can put them in "handmade cards".

Output will appear in "final cards"
